This project has long been defunct, and I wrote it in middle school, so don't judge too hard.
That being said, the code actually isn't *that* bad, and as of the final commit, it actually somewhat 
worked! Which was sort of impressive.

Of course, since then, the Open and Chrome web app specifications have changed, and attempting to run this code
will probably prove futile in any case.

Here's the project summary from the Google Code page:

---

**Summary:**
This Google Chrome extension will provide an interface which through Open Web Apps can be installed as 
Chrome Web Apps. This extension will be produced by Ascerent Tech.

**Technical Details:**
The user will first try to download an Open Web App. Our app will capture this, and convert the manifest 
to a Chrome manifest. It will then package it as a Chrome Hosted App and install it appropriately.

Please note that the current source does not work. At all. Don't try it or it will probably break something 
and throw a bunch of errors :)
