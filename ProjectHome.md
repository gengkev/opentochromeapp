**Summary:**
This Google Chrome extension will provide an interface which through Open Web Apps can be installed as Chrome Web Apps. This extension will be produced by Ascerent Tech.

**Technical Details:**
The user will first try to download an Open Web App. Our app will capture this, and convert the manifest to a Chrome manifest. It will then package it as a Chrome Hosted App and install it appropriately.
